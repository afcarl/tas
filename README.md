#Abstract

TAS stands for True Air Speed. It is a lightweight system to track and analyze real time data. 
TAS is able to handle a lot of incoming data, create visuals to analyze it and take snapshots to furthur examine the data at a specific time. 

The data in TAS is stored for approximately a minute, the idea is to track current trends and analyze real time data while keeping the system light weight.

```
On a separate terminal, run **hellotas.go** by switching to the examples directory and entering the following command:
```
go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/chango/tas/examples/hellotas.go
```
Open any modern web browser and go to the following addresses to see the output of TAS:
